Hello everyone!
Are you using TrashHub? It may only have some “trash” features, but I’d be honored if you give it a try!

I’ve been creating the script completely from scratch for all of you.

Here are a few of its features:

Anti-Tab

Anti-Grab

Anti-Fling

Anti-TP

Anti-Explosion

There are more, but I’ll only list these for now. Please try it out yourself to see the rest!
Since this script was made entirely from scratch, the features might not be that great. :D
Still, I truly appreciate everyone who uses it!
